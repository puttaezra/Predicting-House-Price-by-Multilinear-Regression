Problem Statement:

A real estate company has a dataset containing the prices of properties in a particular region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

Essentially, the company wants â€”

* To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

* To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

* To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

* We shall perform the analysis using both the below methods

* Bottom up approach: Manual method of staring with one variable adding further variables to improve the model
* Top down approach: Using the automated method of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to eliminate variables to arrive at the best fit model.

*Result*:
A regression model that would be able to accurately predict the House Price based on the input variables.
